## **Development and CI/CD Workflow for GMClip**

### **Introduction**

This document outlines the recent changes made to the GMClip project, including improvements to script functionality, dependency management, and integration into a continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline using GitHub Actions. It also highlights the steps taken to ensure compatibility with PyInstaller for packaging and distribution.

----------

### **Changes Made to the Codebase**

#### **1. Refactor: Convert Relative Imports to Absolute Imports**

-   **Problem**: The original codebase used relative imports in various parts of the project. When the application was bundled using PyInstaller, these relative imports led to `ImportError` during runtime, as PyInstaller could not resolve the paths correctly.
    
-   **Solution**: All relative imports were refactored to absolute imports. For example, in `block_editor/__main__.py`, the imports were updated to use absolute paths:
    
    ```python
    from block_editor.gui.video_player
    
    ```
    
    This change ensures that Python can consistently find and load the necessary modules regardless of whether the code is being executed as part of a package or as a standalone executable.
    
-   **Impact**: This change resolves the `ImportError` encountered when running the application in a packaged form. It ensures consistent behavior across different environments and execution contexts, allowing the application to work both as a Python package and a standalone executable.

#### **2. Suppress Console Output in PyInstaller Builds**

-   **Problem**: When packaging the application with PyInstaller, console output (stdout/stderr) was visible even in the packaged executable, which could be distracting or unnecessary for end-users.
    
-   **Solution**: A check was added to suppress console output during the PyInstaller build. The output is redirected to `os.devnull` only when running in the bundled executable:
    
    ```python
    if getattr(sys, 'frozen', False):  # Check if running as a PyInstaller bundle
        sys.stdout = sys.stderr = open(os.devnull, 'w')
    
    ```
    
    This ensures that console output is suppressed when running a packaged executable but is still visible during development.
    
-   **Impact**: The suppressing of console output in the built executable makes the final product cleaner and more user-friendly, while still allowing developers to see output during the development process.

#### **3. Dependency Management: Update `requirements.txt` for `numpy`**

-   **Problem**: The `numpy` version specified in the `requirements.txt` file was initially set to be greater than or equal to `1.6.0` but less than `2.0`. However, building with this version caused issues since the source had to be compiled, making the build process slower.
    
-   **Solution**: The version of `numpy` was updated in `requirements.txt` to require any version greater than `2.0`:
    
    ```plaintext
    numpy>=2.0
    
    ```
    
    This change ensures that the installation of `numpy` from the binary distribution will no longer require building from source, speeding up the installation process and making the build process more efficient.
    
-   **Impact**: The updated dependency ensures that a compatible and efficient version of `numpy` is used, removing the need for slower builds from source.

### **CI/CD Pipeline Integration**

The pipeline is set up in GitHub Actions and is triggered on `push` or `pull_request` events on the `main` branch.

#### **1. GitHub Actions Workflow**

The GitHub Actions workflow automates the following tasks:

1.  **Checkout the Code**: The latest code from the repository is pulled.
    
2.  **Set Up Python**: The pipeline sets up the Python environment with the required version (e.g., Python 3.11).
    
3.  **Install Dependencies**: All dependencies, including `numpy` version greater than `2.0` and other project requirements, are installed using:
    
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
    ```
    
4.  **Run the Build**: The `deploy.py` script is executed, which uses PyInstaller to bundle the application into an executable. The following command is used:
    
    ```bash
    python deploy.py
    
    ```
    
    During this process, PyInstaller packages the application and its dependencies, including the ffmpeg binaries for the relevant platform.
    
5.  **Archive and Upload Artifacts**: The resulting build, located in the `dist/` directory, is archived and uploaded as a release or artifact. The uploaded artifact will contain the packaged executable. The build directory is cleaned up when the pipeline finishes.
    

----------

#### **For Reference: macOS ARM64 Builder**

A dedicated **CI/CD builder** for macOS ARM64 architecture is provided, which automatically handles the build process. The builder simplifies the process of packaging for macOS ARM64 and ensures that the application is bundled with the necessary dependencies, including FFmpeg for the platform. You can rely on this builder for automated packaging for macOS ARM64 platforms.
