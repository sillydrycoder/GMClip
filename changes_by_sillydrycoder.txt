Refactor: Convert relative imports to absolute imports for compatibility with PyInstaller

- Updated imports in `block_editor/__main__.py` to use absolute paths (e.g., `from block_editor.gui.video_player`).
- Resolved runtime ImportError caused by relative imports when packaging the application with PyInstaller.
- Ensures consistent behavior in both standalone executables and Python package execution contexts.

Suppress console output in PyInstaller builds

- Added a check to redirect stdout and stderr to os.devnull only when running a PyInstaller build. This ensures that console output is suppressed in packaged executables while retaining visibility during development.
